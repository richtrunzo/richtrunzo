# About Me

I'm a full-stack software engineer looking for an opportunity within the software development industry.

In early 2019 I began the self-taught path to becoming a software developer and quickly found that I have a passion for it - learning through online tutorials and building small projects in my free time.

This past year, I decided to take the plunge, accelerate my learning, and dedicate myself to software development. I just finished up a 15-week coding bootcamp where I committed 10-12 hours a day to hone my development skills, learn new technologies, and build full-stack projects.
